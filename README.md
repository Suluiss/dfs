Business Website

An e-commerce website for a flower business created using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. The website includes a slideshow which displays a different image each time the page is loaded. It includes validation to ensure text fields are not empty and a valid email address is entered. The user can purchase items from the site (in theory), enter their login details, and have login details validated before receiving a summary of the order. The website connects to a database that contains product information.
